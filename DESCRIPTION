Description: Screening articles for evidence synthesis is typically 
             done using titles and abstracts, however, full text screening 
             can be more efficient because there is no guessing involved 
             when assessing if the methods of a study match inclusion criteria. 
             Full text of articles is also necessary for coding article metadata, 
             such as study location or types of data collected, or for analysing 
             article content, such as with topic modelling. doi2txt facilitates
             full text article screening, coding, and analysis by retrieving
             plain text versions of journal articles based on a doi, if available,
             or bibliographic information such as title and authors when a doi
             is not available or known. It also contains functions for processing
             full text articles, such as coding articles from an ontology of
             topics, or geocoding articles to get actual or approximate 
             latitude and longitude.
